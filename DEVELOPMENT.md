# Development Instructions

For now, this is just a quick checklist to remind me of dependencies that aren't tracked by Cargo.

If you want more details to help you get started, feel free to open an issue!

## What to install

1. Rust stable
2. `docker-compose` (and Docker itself)
3. `cargo-run-bin`
4. (optional) `cargo-binstall`

## Run everything locally

```bash
cargo make dev
```

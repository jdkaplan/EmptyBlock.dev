This is a web development playground for Learning In Public â„¢!

Right now, I'm focusing on collecting all of my scattered Rust Web projects
into one giant app so I can start sharing code between them.

I don't expect anything in this repo to make sense to anyone else yet. But feel
free to email me if you want to talk about anything you find in here.
